The metaheuristic algorithm is inspired by the Andean Condor, which is the largest bird in the world. The metaheuristic Andean Condor Algorithm presents a balance of its population through a performance indicator based on the average quality of the populationâ€™s fitness. This balance determines the number of Andean Condors that will perform an exploration or intensification movements. Andean Condor Algorithm has a flexible design. It allows to easily integrate specific heuristics according to the optimisation problem to be solved.
