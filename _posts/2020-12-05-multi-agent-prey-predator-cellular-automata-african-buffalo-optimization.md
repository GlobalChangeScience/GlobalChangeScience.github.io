This research focused on the resolution of a dynamic prey–predator spatial model. This model has six life cycles and simulates a theoretical population of prey and predators. Cellular automata represent a set of prey and predators. The cellular automata move in a discrete space in a 2d lattice that has the shape of a torus. African buffaloes represent the predators, and the grasslands represent the prey in the African savanna. Each buffalo moves in the discrete space using the proper motion equation of the African buffalo optimization metaheuristic.

Two types of approaches were made with five experiments each. The first approach was the development of a dynamic prey–predator spatial model using the movement of the African buffalo optimization metaheuristic. The second approach added the characteristic of regulating the population of buffaloes using autonomous multi-agents that interact with the model dynamic prey–predator spatial model. According to the obtained results, it was possible to adjust and maintain a balance of prey and predators during a determined period using multi-agents, therefore preventing predators from destroying an entire population of prey in the coexistence space.
